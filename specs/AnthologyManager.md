# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: AnthologyManager

## Name
The **AnthologyManager** functions as the meta‑system for the Recursive–Generative architecture. It serves as the map and key, maintaining a registry of all subsystems, processes, and artifacts.

## Input
Accepts protocols, outputs, and state reports from every subsystem. Also ingests external documents, events, rituals, names, and language data that need to be indexed.

## Function
Maintains a unified process registry and archive. It normalizes subsystem outputs into a common schema, exposes processes for cross‑system queries, and acts as the index and access layer for the entire system.

## Process Loop
1. **Collect**: Ingest outputs and state data from all subsystems.
2. **Normalize**: Convert diverse data into consistent schema entries.
3. **Register**: Assign each entry a unique identifier and process metadata.
4. **Expose**: Provide search and query capabilities for cross‑system navigation.
5. **Archive**: Store process definitions and outputs in durable storage.

## Interpretation
The anthology is the recursive key. It contains the map to all parts of the system, representing every symbolic element as a process with inputs, transformations, and outputs.

## Processes
The AnthologyManager registers the following processes (each defined separately):

- **AcademiaManager**: Manages learning, research, and scholarly cycles.
- **EvolutionScheduler**: Handles growth and mutation cycles.
- **ConflictResolver**: Detects and resolves conflicts.
- **SymbolicInterpreter**: Interprets dreams, symbols, and narratives.
- **ArbitrationEngine**: Provides structured dispute resolution.
- **NodeRouter**: Manages connections and routing between nodes.
- **RuleCompiler**: Compiles and validates symbolic rules.
- **CodeGenerator**: Translates symbolic structures into executable code.
- **ReferenceManager**: Maintains canonical references.
- **EchoHandler**: Processes and replays signals and echoes.
- **ArchiveManager**: Organizes and preserves records.
- **MaskGenerator**: Creates and assigns symbolic masks.
- **ValueExchangeManager**: Facilitates symbolic trade and value exchange.
- **BlockchainSimulator**: Models distributed ledger logic.
- **ProcessMonetizer**: Assigns value to system processes.
- **AudienceClassifier**: Categorizes users and participants.
- **LocationResolver**: Resolves spatial references.
- **SignalThresholdGuard**: Validates signals across analog and digital thresholds.
- **TimeManager**: Manages time functions and cycles.
- **ProcessConverter**: Transforms processes into derivative outputs.
- **ConsumptionManager**: Monitors and manages consumption events.

## Components
Includes a **ProcessRegistry** for storing definitions of all subsystem processes, a **CrossQueryEngine** for navigation across subsystems, and an **ExportPipeline** that packages the full system map for external use.
