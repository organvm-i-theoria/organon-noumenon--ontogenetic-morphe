# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: AudienceClassifier

## Name
The **AudienceClassifier** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It categorizes users or participants into defined tiers or segments.

## Input
Accepts user data, interaction metrics, and symbolic roles or attributes.

## Function
Assigns users to segments and manages audience tiers. This segmentation enables targeted distribution of outputs and access control.

## Process Loop
1. **Collect**: Gather data on user interactions and characteristics.
2. **Classify**: Group users into segments based on rules or algorithms.
3. **Assign**: Determine access levels and roles per segment.
4. **Reclassify**: Update segment assignments as new data arrives.

## Interpretation
Audiences are interpreted as structured groups with roles. The classifier optimizes distribution and personalization across the system.

## Components
Includes an audience tier assignment module for segmentation and access management.
