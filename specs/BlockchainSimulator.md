# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: BlockchainSimulator

## Name
The **BlockchainSimulator** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It models distributed ledger logic for symbolic economies.

## Input
Accepts symbolic actions, transactions, and consensus parameters.

## Function
Tracks actions with verifiable order and persistence. It simulates blockchain behaviour to ensure transparency, immutability, and trust across symbolic exchanges.

## Process Loop
1. **Submit**: Receive symbolic transactions.
2. **Validate**: Verify transaction validity and consensus criteria.
3. **Record**: Add transactions to the ledger.
4. **Distribute**: Propagate updated records to all relevant nodes.

## Interpretation
The blockchain is interpreted as immutable symbolic history. The simulator ensures transparency and trust by providing a tamper‑evident record.

## Components
Includes modules for simulation and implementation of symbolic blockchains, including consensus and propagation logic.
