# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: CodeGenerator

## Name
The **CodeGenerator** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It transforms symbolic structures into executable code.

## Input
Accepts symbolic, linguistic, and numeric inputs, including grammars and patterns.

## Function
Translates abstract symbolic structures into actionable instructions. It bridges the gap between expression and execution.

## Process Loop
1. **Submit**: Receive symbolic input.
2. **Compile**: Convert symbolic forms into code.
3. **Test**: Validate the generated code for correctness.
4. **Integrate**: Deploy compiled code into system runtime.

## Interpretation
Symbol‑to‑code translation is treated as expression into execution. The generator aligns meaning with operation to enable functional outputs.

## Components
Includes a core compiler that converts symbolic inputs into system‑level instructions.
