# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: ConflictResolver

## Name
The **ConflictResolver** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It manages detection and resolution of conflicting inputs or states.

## Input
Accepts symbolic data, disputes, and duplicated inputs requiring analysis.

## Function
Provides recursive reflection and resolution of conflicts. It helps balance competing narratives or data within the system.

## Process Loop
1. **Intake**: Receive conflicting data.
2. **Mirror**: Reflect and duplicate inputs to expose contradictions.
3. **Analyze**: Identify points of conflict.
4. **Resolve**: Stabilize outcomes or mediate compromises.

## Interpretation
Mirroring is interpreted as a recursive confrontation with contradictions. The module surfaces tensions to clarify meaning.

## Components
Includes a conflict resolution engine that processes contradictions until balance is achieved.
