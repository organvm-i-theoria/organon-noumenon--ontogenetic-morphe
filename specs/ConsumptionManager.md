# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: ConsumptionManager

## Name
The **ConsumptionManager** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It governs ingestion, evaluation, and tracking of consumption within the system.

## Input
Accepts symbolic content, resources, and user actions representing consumption events.

## Function
Monitors and manages consumption. It evaluates the validity and risk of ingested content, logs consumption events, and provides feedback to maintain balance.

## Process Loop
1. **Intake**: Receive content or resource inputs for consumption.
2. **Evaluate**: Check inputs for validity, safety, and compliance.
3. **Log**: Record consumption events and associated metadata.
4. **Feedback**: Provide metrics and adjustments to related subsystems.

## Interpretation
Consumption is interpreted as the transformation of resources into effects. The manager ensures safety and balance in symbolic ingestion across the system.

## Components
Includes an ingestion risk evaluator and logging mechanism for consumption events.
