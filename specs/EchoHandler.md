# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: EchoHandler

## Name
The **EchoHandler** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It manages the processing and replay of signals and echoes.

## Input
Accepts signals, echoes, and responses needing handling or replay.

## Function
Governs processing and replay of echoes. It records, repeats and re‑contextualizes signals to maintain continuity across recursive cycles.

## Process Loop
1. **Capture**: Receive incoming signals or echoes.
2. **Process**: Classify and transform as needed.
3. **Replay**: Reissue or transmit signals to appropriate nodes.
4. **Store**: Archive signals for future recall.

## Interpretation
Echoes are treated as recursive returns of meaning. The handler enables continuity and resonance across the system.

## Components
Includes a signal handling module for capture, processing, and replay.
