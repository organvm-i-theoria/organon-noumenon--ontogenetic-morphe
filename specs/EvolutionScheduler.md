# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: EvolutionScheduler

## Name
The **EvolutionScheduler** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It manages the timing and progression of growth and mutation cycles.

## Input
Accepts seasonal cycles, symbolic triggers, and system state inputs. These inputs determine when and how new growth phases are initiated.

## Function
Governs symbolic growth, mutation, and renewal processes. It models expansion, branching and transformation within recursive systems.

## Process Loop
1. **Intake**: Receive seasonal or symbolic input.
2. **Process**: Apply mutation logic to generate new patterns.
3. **Evaluate**: Assess new patterns for stability and coherence.
4. **Integrate**: Incorporate viable outcomes back into the system.

## Interpretation
Symbolic growth is interpreted as adaptation and renewal. Bloom phases mark progress in cycles of knowledge and structure.

## Components
Includes a scheduler and mutation handler that regulate timing and manage pattern changes.
