# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: LocationResolver

## Name
The **LocationResolver** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It resolves spatial references and manages symbolic places.

## Input
Accepts spatial markers, coordinates, and symbolic place identifiers.

## Function
Determines and manages symbolic places. It resolves ambiguous references into structured locations and maintains a coherent spatial ontology.

## Process Loop
1. **Collect**: Receive place identifiers or spatial markers.
2. **Resolve**: Match identifiers against the system’s spatial ontology.
3. **Assign**: Link resolved locations to entities or events.
4. **Archive**: Store location definitions for reuse and lookup.

## Interpretation
Places are interpreted as nodes in a symbolic space. The resolver provides stability and consistency across spatial references.

## Components
Includes a symbolic place resolver that maps and maintains locations within the system.
