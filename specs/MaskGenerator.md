# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: MaskGenerator

## Name
The **MaskGenerator** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It manages the creation and assignment of symbolic masks that abstract identity.

## Input
Accepts symbolic attributes, identity markers, and classification parameters.

## Function
Generates, assigns, and manages symbolic masks. These masks represent roles or states and help maintain privacy or abstraction within the system.

## Process Loop
1. **Collect**: Gather identity attributes and parameters.
2. **Generate**: Create symbolic masks based on input attributes.
3. **Assign**: Link masks to entities, roles, or processes.
4. **Update**: Modify or reassign masks as identities evolve.

## Interpretation
Masks are interpreted as symbolic representations of roles and states. The generator abstracts complexity into consistent identifiers.

## Components
Includes a mask generation and assignment module that produces and manages masks.
