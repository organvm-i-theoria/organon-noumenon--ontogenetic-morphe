# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: NodeRouter

## Name
The **NodeRouter** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It manages connections and routing between symbolic nodes.

## Input
Accepts node definitions, channel descriptions, and routing requests.

## Function
Governs the configuration and management of relationships between nodes. It enables flexible and adaptive interconnections across the system.

## Process Loop
1. **Register**: Add nodes into the routing system.
2. **Configure**: Establish connections based on rules or requests.
3. **Evaluate**: Monitor routes for efficiency and integrity.
4. **Adjust**: Optimize connections and adapt to changes.

## Interpretation
Connections are interpreted as flows of meaning and data. The NodeRouter provides adaptive pathways across symbolic systems.

## Components
Includes a node‑to‑node patching module for dynamic routing and configuration.
