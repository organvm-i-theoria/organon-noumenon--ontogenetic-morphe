# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: ProcessConverter

## Name
The **ProcessConverter** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It transforms symbolic workflows into derivative outputs.

## Input
Accepts symbolic workflows, inputs, and parameters defining desired transformations.

## Function
Converts processes into derivative products or compressed representations. It enables the translation of activity into new structures and forms.

## Process Loop
1. **Intake**: Receive defined processes and parameters.
2. **Transform**: Apply conversion rules to generate outputs.
3. **Evaluate**: Assess the efficiency and fidelity of converted outputs.
4. **Integrate**: Integrate results back into the system for further use.

## Interpretation
Conversion is interpreted as the translation of activity into new structures. The converter enables symbolic productivity and compression.

## Components
Includes a process compression and conversion engine that performs transformations and evaluates outcomes.
