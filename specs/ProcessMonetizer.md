# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: ProcessMonetizer

## Name
The **ProcessMonetizer** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It converts processes into monetizable products or services.

## Input
Accepts system processes, workflows, and symbolic outputs.

## Function
Transforms processes into products or services with assigned value. It quantifies and tracks value produced by system workflows.

## Process Loop
1. **Ingest**: Receive defined processes or workflows.
2. **Convert**: Translate processes into tangible outputs (products or services).
3. **Value**: Assign values and pricing models.
4. **Distribute**: Release products or services and track performance.

## Interpretation
Monetization is interpreted as the assignment of value to processes. The monetizer integrates symbolic activity into economic structures.

## Components
Includes a process‑to‑product compiler that quantifies and converts processes into monetizable outputs.
