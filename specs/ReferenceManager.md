# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: ReferenceManager

## Name
The **ReferenceManager** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It establishes and maintains canonical references.

## Input
Accepts canonical texts, metadata, citations, and authoritative records.

## Function
Establishes and maintains authoritative references for use across all subsystems. It secures foundations for recursive knowledge and provides stable anchoring.

## Process Loop
1. **Intake**: Receive references or canonical records.
2. **Validate**: Check authenticity and completeness.
3. **Update**: Correct and refine as needed.
4. **Distribute**: Provide references to other subsystems.

## Interpretation
Canon is interpreted as a stable core for recursive systems. It anchors processes in consistent reference points and prevents drift.

## Components
Includes a validation module for canonical reference management and distribution.
