# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: SignalThresholdGuard

## Name
The **SignalThresholdGuard** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It monitors and validates signals across analog and digital thresholds.

## Input
Accepts analog and digital signals requiring validation or conversion.

## Function
Validates, monitors, and transforms signals as they cross analog–digital boundaries. It ensures fidelity and coherence during conversions.

## Process Loop
1. **Receive**: Intake mixed signals (analog or digital).
2. **Validate**: Assess whether signals meet threshold criteria.
3. **Convert**: Transform signals between analog and digital formats when required.
4. **Distribute**: Route converted signals to appropriate subsystems.

## Interpretation
Signal thresholds are interpreted as symbolic boundaries. The guard protects against distortion and information loss in system communication.

## Components
Includes an analog–digital conversion guard that monitors thresholds and performs transformations.
