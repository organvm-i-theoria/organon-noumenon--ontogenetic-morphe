# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: SymbolicInterpreter

## Name
The **SymbolicInterpreter** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It interprets symbolic inputs and transforms them into structured guidance.

## Input
Accepts symbolic inputs such as dreams, visions, constructed languages, or narrative fragments.

## Function
Governs the interpretation and processing of symbolic material. It distills meaning from complex or ambiguous inputs.

## Process Loop
1. **Collect**: Gather symbolic inputs.
2. **Interpret**: Apply interpretive frameworks and collective deliberation.
3. **Synthesize**: Produce structured outcomes or insights.
4. **Integrate**: Feed the outputs back into the system for further iteration.

## Interpretation
Symbols are treated as encoded sequences that reflect collective concerns. The interpreter extracts meaning to inform system decision‑making.

## Components
Includes a symbol processing system that organizes, interprets, and preserves symbolic content.
