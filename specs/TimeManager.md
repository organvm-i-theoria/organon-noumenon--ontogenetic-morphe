# Recursive–Generative Organizational Body: TimeManager

## Name
The **TimeManager** is a subsystem of the Recursive–Generative Organizational Body. It governs time functions and recursive scheduling.

## Input
Accepts timestamps, schedules, cycle definitions, and symbolic time markers.

## Function
Manages time functions and cycle tracking. It ensures that recursive events occur in ordered sequence and that time‑dependent processes are synchronized.

## Process Loop
1. **Register**: Receive events with associated times or cycles.
2. **Assign**: Map events to appropriate cycles or schedules.
3. **Monitor**: Track event timing and trigger events as needed.
4. **Adjust**: Modify schedules to account for drift, recursion, or system changes.

## Interpretation
Time is interpreted as a controlled recursive variable. The manager provides stability and coherence in symbolic timing.

## Components
Includes a recursive cycle tracker and scheduler to orchestrate time‑based events.
